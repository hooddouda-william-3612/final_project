# CS 162 Final Project
    Instructor:
    Joe Paris
    10:00 AM class

Program "final.py" was created by:
    Simeon Patton
    William Hood-Douda

This program is based in python3 and is intended to be a "Hello World" sort of
program. The program will take in a file containing a string (default = Hello World).
Once the string is deconstructed, we will use python to search and download images
that correspond to the individual characters within the string. These images will then
be stitched together on a GUI interface built from tkinter for python. The tkinter window
will be sized accordingly to the amount of characters within the original file. A scrollbar
built within the tkinter canvas will allow the user to scroll through the whole reconstructed
message.

Project Brief:
--------------
The final project in CS 162 was to create a program that uses a module that
has not been used in the class before. The proposal for the final project
is due on Monday, May 27th 2019 to the instructor.

The program is to have:
    An object oriented layout - 
        Using multiple Class elements we are to create
        the objects for the program with functions built within the Class, each to
        perform a single task.

    At least one function in the program must be recursive - 
        This is handled within
        the program with the "get_pictures" function.

    Error handling built within the Classes.

    File I/O - 
        The program will read from a text file and then use the incoming
        string as the input for the entire program. The output is handled by creating
        a bibliography of sorts into a new file within the working directory that contains
        the paths of all of the images that were downloaded upon running the program.

    Tests for at least 50% of the functions.

The program is to have the correct documentation and pass the created test functions as well
as "pycodestle", "pydocstyle", "pylint", and "pytest" as used throughout the class.

The final project is due no later than June 12th at noon and must be submitted to GitHub along
with the accompaning documentation.

There is no stated Extra Credit that is associated with this project.
